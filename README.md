# personal_projects
A few bits of code from University assessments and personal experimentation- will add as I go along!

Will start with the foundation for a system for smart devices for use in the home.  Includes some basic search methods and unit testing.

Have also added my first website, experimentation with HTML and CSS.  Work in progress of course!
